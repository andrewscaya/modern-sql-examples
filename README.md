# Examples for my Modern SQL talk

This requires PostgreSQL 9.6 to work (9.5 MIGHT work, not tested)

```
git clone https://github.com/auroraeosrose/modern-sql-examples.git
Ubuntu 17.04
sudo apt-get install postgresql
sudo –i –u postgres
psql
\timing
```

You'll need to copy and paste each file into the terminal as you are running in interactive mode
You can run sql scripts from the command line using psql but it will be more useful to see each example

Run the ddl script first to create example tables and populate them
